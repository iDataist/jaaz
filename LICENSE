Open Source License for Jaaz
Jaaz is released under a modified Apache License 2.0, with the following additional terms and conditions tailored to its local-first, multimodal AI Agent architecture:

1. Permitted Use & Commercial Restrictions
   You are free to use Jaaz for research, personal use, or internal business purposes, including as a component within a larger local or cloud-based system. However, a commercial license must be obtained under the following conditions:
   a. Multi-tenant Hosting or SaaS Use
   Operating Jaaz as a multi-tenant service, such as offering hosted design or generation services to external clients via Jaaz APIs or frontend, requires a commercial license or written authorization.
   Tenant Definition: Each isolated workspace or client instance (whether via API, UI, or CLI) is considered a tenant under this clause.
   b. Branding and Attribution
   When using the Jaaz frontend interface (including default dashboards or tools):
   You may not remove, obscure, or alter the Jaaz logo, name, or copyright without written consent.
   This clause does not apply to headless API-only usage or frontend-overridden deployments with explicit written authorization.
   c. Model Integration & Distribution
   Jaaz supports the integration of local and external models. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with third-party model licenses. Redistribution of bundled models requires adherence to each model’s respective license.
2. Contributions and Upstream Rights
   By contributing to the Jaaz project (via pull requests, issues, or other means), you agree that:
   a. License Adjustments
   The maintainers reserve the right to update this license to strengthen or relax conditions as the project evolves, with prior notice in the main repository.
   b. Commercial Use of Contributions
   All contributed code, configurations, and documentation may be used by the maintainers for both open-source and commercial purposes, including but not limited to Jaaz’s paid enterprise deployments, cloud integrations, and private model offerings.
3. Intellectual Property & UI
   The visual and interaction design of Jaaz (including iconography, component arrangement, and prompt UX) is protected under applicable UI/UX design rights and may not be copied or resold as a derivative product without permission.
4. Base License
   Aside from the above specific terms, Jaaz adheres to the Apache License 2.0. Full license text available at:
